# Brick Breaker #
A Brick Breaker-like game developed in Code.org AppLab.

# How to Play #
1. Go to the link below to play the game. (This is the recommended way to run the app, as using the HTML files may cause bugs.)
https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/Igt5rNJAZXWXivoRmj-ZgV4EkAAytB1AlCf2EOPwr58
2. You can also download all the files here and open the `index.html` file in a browser to play the game (which will result in some bugs.)

# Files #
From Code.org "Exported to Web" Option:
* `applab/applab.js` - This file contains the App Lab library, which has all the
  javascript that applab uses to run the app.
* `applab/applab.css` - This file contains some default CSS styling for the app.
* `index.html` - This is the HTML file designed in AppLab using the
  Design tab. It contains all the buttons, text inputs, and other controls for
  your app. Go here to add additional controls to the app.
* `style.css` - This file defines the custom styling for each control in the
  app specified under the Design tab. Go here to change the colors,
  positions, dimensions, and other properties of the app's controls.
* `code.js` - This file has all the code written for your app. Go here to add
  new behavior to the app.
* `assets` - This is a directory with all the asset files (pictures and sounds)
  that uploaded in App Lab.

# Issues #
Some issues may be present, including:
* The right button going faster than the left button (only on the HTML version).

# Development History #
I originally made the initial version of this program around March 2022 to see how far I could go with making an app on Code.org App Lab after doing Code.org lessons in the AP Computer Science Principles course. The initial version was also a gift for my dad's birthday. Later, I developed version 2 of this app based on the initial version starting in February 2024 and occasionally added improvements until September 2024. These improvements include adding new features to the game, like a high score and easy mode, and improvements to the code. While creating this program, I read online manuals for the functions in Code.org AppLab and viewed other AppLabs as a reference for using some functions. The publishment of this program is for those interested in the personal projects I developed over the years.
